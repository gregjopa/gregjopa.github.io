I'm a software engineer living in Chicago working for [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/).

Over the past decade I've focused on building web applications. I've worked for companies
ranging from startups to large dot-coms ([YellowPages.com](https://www.yellowpages.com/) and [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com/)).
With every project I work on, I'm a voice for the user and enjoy discovering new ways to optimize the user experience.

I'm a Christian, saved by the amazing grace of Jesus Christ through faith.
I attend [Four Corners Community Church](https://fccc.church/) and enjoy playing guitar and drums in their worship band.
I love music and try to incorporate it into most of my blog posts.

I'm blessed with an amazing family. Here's my wife Raquel and my two kids, Micah and Delilah.
