<BioWithPhoto>

I consider myself an expert pancake maker and a mediocre software engineer. I live in the Chicago suburbs and work at [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) as an Engineering Manager.

Over the past 15 years I've focused on building web applications. I've worked for companies
ranging from startups to large dotcoms ([YellowPages.com](https://www.yellowpages.com/) and [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com/)).
Throughout my career I've bounced back and forth from being an engineering manager to being an individual contributor.
I'm passionate about helping others succeed and creating teams that have fun and trust each other.
With every project I work on, I'm a voice for the user and enjoy discovering new ways to optimize the user experience.

I'm a Christian, saved by the amazing grace of Jesus Christ through faith.
I attend [Four Corners Community Church](https://fccc.church/) and enjoy teaching Sunday School and playing guitar in the worship band.
I love music and try to incorporate it into most of my blog posts.

I'm blessed with an amazing family. Here's my wife Raquel and my three kids: Micah, Delilah, and Hannah.
