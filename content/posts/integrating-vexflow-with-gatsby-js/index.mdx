import VexflowDemo from "./LoadableVexflow";

My new blog is built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and my goal is to make easy to insert
sheet music and guitar tab into blog posts. I'm a big fan of the [Vexflow Music Notation library](https://vexflow.com/)
and for this post I'm going to explain how I got Vexflow working with Gatsby.

### Demo

I struggled a bit with server-side rendering, but eventually got it working! Here's the end result:

<VexflowDemo width="700" height="180" />

### Integration Details

There are 3 things I had to do to get Vexflow working with Gatsby.js.

1. [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) - The Gatsby framework renders everything
   server-side and Vexflow does not play nicely by default. The Vexflow library depends on 'window' and several
   other browser features. To work around this issue I used react-loadable to only load my VexflowDemo component on the client-side.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Loadable from "react-loadable";

export default Loadable({
  // this "./VexflowDemo" component loads Vexflow and draws the sheet music
  loader: () => import("./VexflowDemo"),
  loading() {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  },
});
```

2. [DOM Node Ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) - the Vexflow library takes care of the complex
   rendering for creating sheet music. It just needs a specific container element to use. The 'ref' feature makes it easy to
   share the container element with Vexflow without having to hardcode any id values.

3. [useEffect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) - the Vexflow rendering process requires
   a DOM node reference so we need to make sure the DOM is ready. With React, we can accomplish this using 'useEffect' or 'componentDidMount()'.

Here's a snippet showing how to use 'useEffect' with 'ref':

```jsx
function VexflowDemo(props) {
  const notesContainerRef = React.useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (notesContainerRef.current !== null) {
      // this draw() function contains all Vexflow code for rendering the sheet music
      draw(notesContainerRef.current, props);
    }
  });

  return <div ref={notesContainerRef} />;
}
```
